=====
Setup
=====

In order to run the PRM tests you need 3 working servers.  All the 
configuration details must be set in the "config" file and the servers
must met the following requirements::

    - Be accesssible on distinct IPs from the test host
    - The test host is not one of the 3 hosts
    - MySQL is configured with identical dataset, like after mysql_install_db
    - root ssh is possible from the test host using a key, same key for all
      3 hosts.
    - MySQL root user can be accessed from the test hosts, all privileges 
      with grant option
    - PRM is configured, Pacemaker and Corosync are stopped, they don't start
      automatically after boot. 

  
Each test is made of a script that has 3 phases::

    - setup
    - test
    - cleanup

The initial state is corosync and pacemaker stopped. The setup phase brings 
the cluster ready for the test, the test phase is the actual test and
cleanup returns the  cluster to the initial state.
